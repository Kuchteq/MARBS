The update introduces MARBS's two new homegrown programs written in C. First one being [marbs-themetime](https://github.com/Kuchteq/marbs-themetime) which automatically adjusts your current theme based on the sunset in one's current location. The second one is long awaited battery critical level battery indicator provided by super lean [marbs-cooltify](https://github.com/Kuchteq/marbs-cooltify). Once the battery hits 5,2 and 1 percent level, it displays a nicely animated OSD notification warning.
#### Action required for existing users
Run the following to install marbs-themetime.
```console
cd ~/.local/src && git clone https://github.com/Kuchteq/marbs-themetime
cd marbs-themetime && makepkg -sif --noconfirm
```
For themetime to recognize your location, it uses the value present at */etc/timezone* or the *TZ* environment variable. So one needs to add one's location. To see the available ones you can view **/usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab** file. For example for Helsinki, run:
```console
echo Europe/Helsinki | sudo tee /etc/timezone
```

Next, run the following to install marbs-cooltify.
```console
cd ~/.local/src && git clone https://github.com/Kuchteq/marbs-cooltify
cd marbs-cooltify && makepkg -sif --noconfirm
```

And finally, as with every MARBS update, run:
```console
cd ~ && git pull 
```
in the home directory to pull the latest dotfiles changes. Those include changes done to startw and sb-battery scripts for the two new features.
