imv is just a really simple image-viewer.
It is controlled by the keyboard with the vim style keybindings.

## Documentation

## Running

imv is opened automatically when you select a photo file to open from [lf](/lf) or another program.
Obviously you can run it from the command line by running `imv filename.mp4`, etc.

## Bindings
### [ðŸ—Ž PDF cheat sheet](/imv_guide.pdf)

## Configuration

- `~/.config/imv/config` -- custom key bindings.
