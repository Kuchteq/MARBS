Want to check out MARBS without first installing it? Grab the ISO from here:

### [ðŸ’¿ ISO download](/marbs.iso)

On Linux you can burn it to your pendrive using 
```fish
sudo dd if=marbs.iso of=/dev/sdx status='progress'
```
where *sdax* is the pendrive device.

On Windows, you can download [rufus](https://rufus.ie) and burn the image with it.

This iso is based on Artix Linux with Dinit.
