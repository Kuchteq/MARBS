dwl (dynamic window manager for wayland) is the bedrock of MARBS and its graphical environment.

## Using

#### Everything that you do with your graphical interface is managed by a keybinding.
### [ðŸ—Ž PDF cheat sheet](/programdocs/dwl_guide.pdf)

The guide includes keybindings with basic navigation, app launching and more. If you have never used a dynamic tiler, I urge you to read [Dave's Visual Guide to dwm](https://ratfactor.com/dwm) to get better understanding of window tiling and navigation. It is one of the best resources about it out there.
