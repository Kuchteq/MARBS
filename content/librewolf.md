### Other tweaks

Annoying Firefox features have been disabled, such as push notifications, the pocket and automatic password input.

The settings can be changed either by typing `about:config` in the address bar or by better yet, editing `~/.librewolf/librewolf.overrides.cfg`.

### Add-ons
Several add-ons come installed by default.
Note that they can be immediately enabled by the user in the top right corner, but might not come enabled.

- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) -- ad-blocker.
- [LocalCDN](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/localcdn-fork-of-decentraleyes/) -- fork of the popular Decentraleyes, decreases calls made to the big CDN providers for various web frameworks and assets.
- [I still don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/istilldontcareaboutcookies/) -- removes those stupid cookie notifications that try to annoyingly ask you for your data.
