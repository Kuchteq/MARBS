### Other tweaks

Other annoying Firefox features have been disabled, such as push notifications and the pocket.

With any of these settings or the Arkenfox ones, they can be changed in `about:config`.

### Add-ons

Several add-ons come installed by default.
Note that they can be immediately enabled by the user in the top right corner, but might not come enabled.
